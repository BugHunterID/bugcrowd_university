# An Introduction to BCU

Bugcrowd University was created in 2018 as a place for Bug Hunters and Security Professionals to find useful topics and tools for testing. As the crowd has expanded and diversified, so have our educational materials! BCU now covers a wide variety of content and topics for every skill level, such as conference talks, slide decks, videos and modules to work through. The Bugcrowd team will continue to update and add new content to this repository, but we also encourage our researchers to submit their own work for others to learn from! 

If you have any questions about this repository, please reach out to [support@bugcrowd.com]. Thanks!
